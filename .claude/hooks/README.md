## Three-Phase Architecture

The multi-linter hook uses a format-collect-delegate approach:

### Phase 1: Auto-Format (silent)

- Applies automatic formatting to fix common issues
- Runs silently without reporting to Claude
- Reduces subprocess workload by ~40-50%

### Phase 2: Collect Violations (JSON)

- Runs linters to detect remaining issues
- Collects violations as structured JSON with line/column/code/message
- Does NOT report to main agent directly

### Phase 3: Delegate + Verify

- Spawns `claude -p` subprocess with violations JSON
- Subprocess uses Edit tool to fix each violation
- After subprocess exits, re-runs Phase 1 + Phase 2 to verify
- Exit 0 if all fixed, Exit 2 if violations remain

|  4. Re-run Phase 2 to count remaining violations             |
|  5. Exit 0 if fixed, Exit 2 if violations remain            |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**SFC Handling** (`.vue`, `.svelte`, `.astro`): These Single-File Component
formats are not fully supported by Biome. They receive Semgrep-only coverage
with a one-time warning per extension per session.

**Nursery Rules**: Biome nursery rules are experimental and configurable via
`biome_nursery` in config.json: `"off"` (skip), `"warn"` (advisory count),
or `"error"` (blocking). The hook validates that config.json and biome.json
nursery settings are in sync.

## Message Styling

Hook messages use prefixed format for severity classification:

### Marked Format (Hook-Specific)

All hook messages use `[hook:]` prefix with severity:

```text
[hook:error] claude binary not found, cannot delegate
[hook:warning] hadolint 2.10.0 < 2.12.0 (some features may not work)
[hook:advisory] Duplicate code detected
[hook] 3 violation(s) remain after delegation
```

| Prefix | Meaning | Exit Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[hook:error]` | Fatal error, cannot proceed | 2 |
| `[hook:warning]` | Non-fatal issue, continues | 0 or 2 |
| `[hook:advisory]` | Informational only | 0 |
| `[hook]` | Violations remain after delegation | 2 |

### Subprocess Prompt

The subprocess receives violations as JSON with explicit rules:

```text
You are a code quality fixer. Fix ALL violations listed below in ${file}.

VIOLATIONS:
[{"line": 15, "column": 5, "code": "F841", "message": "...", "linter": "ruff"}]

RULES:
1. Use targeted Edit operations only - never rewrite the entire file
2. Fix each violation at its reported line/column
3. After fixing, run the formatter: ${format_cmd}
4. Verify by re-running the linter
5. If a violation cannot be fixed, explain why
```

This prompt embeds the Boy Scout Rule ("Fix ALL") and targeted edit strategy.

### Detailed Subprocess Prompt Examples

**For Python files:**

```text
You are a code quality fixer. Fix ALL violations listed below in ./path/to/file.py.

VIOLATIONS:
[
  {
    "line": 15,
    "column": 5,
    "code": "F841",
    "message": "Local variable `unused_var` is assigned to but never used",
    "linter": "ruff"
  },
  {
    "line": 23,
    "column": 12,
    "code": "unresolved-attribute",
    "message": "Cannot access attribute `foo` on type `None`",
    "linter": "ty"
  },
  {
    "line": 45,
    "column": 1,
    "code": "PYD002",
    "message": "Field default should use Field() with default parameter",
    "linter": "pydantic"
  }
]

RULES:
1. Use targeted Edit operations only - never rewrite the entire file
2. Fix each violation at its reported line/column
3. After fixing, run the formatter:
   ruff format './path/to/file.py'
4. Verify by re-running the linter
5. If a violation cannot be fixed, explain why

Do not add comments explaining fixes. Do not refactor beyond what's needed.
```

**For Shell files:**

```text
VIOLATIONS:
[
  {"line": 12, "column": 1, "code": "SC2034", "message": "UNUSED_VAR appears unused.", "linter": "shellcheck"},
  {"line": 25, "column": 8, "code": "SC2086", "message": "Double quote to prevent globbing.", "linter": "shellcheck"}
]

RULES:
...
3. After fixing, run the formatter: shfmt -w -i 2 -ci -bn './path/to/file.sh'
```

**For Dockerfile:**

```text
VIOLATIONS:
[
  {"line": 1, "column": 1, "code": "DL3007", "message": "Using latest is prone to errors.", "linter": "hadolint"},
  {"line": 1, "column": 1, "code": "DL3049", "message": "Label `maintainer` is missing.", "linter": "hadolint"}
]
```

**For TypeScript/JS/CSS files:**

```text
VIOLATIONS:
[
  {"line": 5, "column": 7, "code": "lint/correctness/noUnusedVariables", "message": "This variable is unused.", "linter": "biome"},
  {"line": 12, "column": 15, "code": "lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals", "message": "Use === instead of ==.", "linter": "biome"}
]

RULES:
...
3. After fixing, run the formatter: biome format --write './path/to/file.ts'
```

**Note:** `format_cmd` is empty for YAML and Dockerfile (no auto-formatter available).

## What Each Agent Sees

### Main Agent Visibility

| Scenario | Message | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No violations | (nothing) | 0 |
| Violations fixed by subprocess | (nothing) | 0 |
| Violations remain after subprocess | `[hook] N remain` | 2 |
| jscpd duplicates found | `[hook:advisory]...` | 0/2 |
| hadolint too old | `[hook:warning]...` | 0/2 |
| claude not found | `[hook:error]...` | 2 |

### Subprocess Visibility

The subprocess receives ONLY the prompt and has access to:

- **Tools**: Edit, Read, Bash
- **Max turns**: 10
- **File context**: The file path is passed as an argument

The subprocess does **NOT** see:

- Main agent's conversation history
- Other files edited in the session
- Any hook output

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Hook Internal Visibility

The hook (bash script) sees:

- **Stdin**: JSON with `tool_input.file_path`
- **Linter outputs**: JSON format from each linter
- **Subprocess exit code**: Ignored via `|| true`
- **Verification counts**: From `rerun_phase2()`

### Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Who generates structured JSON? | Hook (bash) runs linters with JSON flags |
| Why JSON instead of raw output? | Unified format for line/column parsing |
| How does main agent receive messages? | Via stderr when hook exits code 2 |
| Is main agent blocked? | Yes, hooks are synchronous |
| Does main agent see subprocess work? | No, output discarded (`>/dev/null`) |

## All Possible Messages

| # | Message | Line | Trigger | Dest |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hook input JSON | stdin | Always | Hook |
| 2 | Subprocess prompt | 100-113 | has_issues | Subprocess |
| 3 | `[hook:advisory]...` | 357-364 | jscpd clones | stderr |
| 4 | `[hook:warning]...` | 479 | Old hadolint | stderr |
| 5 | `[hook:error]...` | 131 | No claude | stderr |
| 6 | `[hook] N remain` | 603 | Verify fails | stderr |

## Exit Code Strategy

| Exit | Meaning | Main Agent Sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | No issues, or subprocess fixed all | Nothing |
| 2 | Violations remain after delegation | `[hook] N remain` |

**Key behavior**: The hook delegates to subprocess first. Exit 2 only occurs if
violations **remain after** the subprocess attempts fixes. All output goes to
stderr.

**Note on Exit 2 rarity**: In practice, exit 2 is rare because the subprocess
is highly effective. It has full Edit tool access and will aggressively fix
violations - including deleting problematic code, refactoring entire functions,
or removing unused imports. Exit 2 typically only occurs when:

- Subprocess times out (max 10 turns exceeded)
- File permission errors prevent editing
- Conflicting fixes where fix A breaks fix B
- Linter false positives that cannot be resolved

## Hook Execution Model

Hooks are **SYNCHRONOUS**. The main agent is **BLOCKED** until the hook
completes:

## Linter Behavior by File Type

| Type | Phase 1: Auto-Format | Phase 2: Collect Violations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | `ruff format` + `--fix` | Ruff+ty+pydantic+vulture+bandit*** |
| Shell | `shfmt -w` | ShellCheck semantic |
| TS/JS/CSS | `biome check --write` | Biome lint+nursery+Semgrep+jscpd** |
| JSON | `jaq '.'` or `biome format`* | Syntax errors |
| TOML | `taplo fmt` | Syntax errors |
| Markdown | `markdownlint --no-globs --fix` | Unfixable rules |
| YAML | (none) | All yamllint issues |
| Dockerfile | (none) | All hadolint issues |

**Phase 3** applies to all file types: collected violations are passed to the
subprocess for fixing, then verified.

**\*\* Semgrep and jscpd run in advisory/session-scoped mode** for TS/JS/CSS
files (separate session tracking from Python). Semgrep requires `.semgrep.yml`
in the project root and runs after 3+ TS files modified.

**\* JSON formatting** uses Biome when TypeScript is enabled and Biome is
available (D6), falling back to jaq pretty-print otherwise.

**Note on Markdown --no-globs**: The hook uses `--no-globs` to disable config
globs from `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`. Without this flag, markdownlint-cli2
merges the explicit file path with config globs, causing it to lint many files
instead of just the edited file.

**\*\*\* jscpd runs in advisory mode** - reports duplicates but does not block.
Session-scoped (runs once after 3+ Python files modified). See "Note on jscpd"
below for details.

**Dockerfile Pattern Matching:** The hook recognizes these patterns:

- `Dockerfile` - Standard Dockerfile
- `Dockerfile.*` - Named variants (e.g., `Dockerfile.nginx`)
- `*/Dockerfile` - Dockerfiles in subdirectories
- `*/Dockerfile.*` - Named variants in subdirectories
- `*.dockerfile` - Alternative extension

### Subprocess Fix Strategies

The subprocess (Phase 3) uses different strategies depending on violation type:

| Violation | Model | Fix Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F841 (unused variable) | Haiku | Delete the assignment line |
| C901 (complexity) | Sonnet | Refactor to early returns |
| PLR0913 (too many args) | Sonnet | Group params into dataclass |
| Type errors (None access) | Sonnet | Add None checks, type guards |
| SC2086 (unquoted var) | Haiku | Add quotes: `$VAR` -> `"${VAR}"` |
| Unresolved import | Sonnet | Remove import and dependent code |
| YAML indentation | Haiku | Fix spacing to match style |
| D401 (imperative mood) | Sonnet | Rewrite "Returns" -> "Return" |
| D417 (missing Args) | Sonnet | Add Args section from signature |
| D205/D400/D415 | Sonnet | Fix formatting/punctuation |

**Important**: The subprocess prioritizes linter satisfaction over code
preservation. It will delete entire functions or imports if that's the
simplest way to resolve a violation. This is intentional - the hook enforces
the Boy Scout Rule aggressively.

### Phase 1 vs Phase 3 Fix Scope

Not all violations require the subprocess. Phase 1 auto-formatters handle
many issues silently:

| Fixed by Phase 1 (auto-format) | Requires Phase 3 (subprocess) |
| --- | --- |
| Import sorting (I001) | Unused variables (F841)* |
| Blank lines (E302, E303) | Complexity (C901, PLR*) |
| Trailing whitespace | Type errors (ty) |
| Quote style | Pydantic issues (PYD*) |
| Indentation (Python) | Unresolved imports |
| JSON/TOML formatting | ShellCheck semantic issues |
| D400/D415 (punctuation)** | D401/D417 (semantic docstrings) |

*F841 has an "unsafe" fix in ruff that Phase 1 skips; subprocess handles it.
**D400/D415 have auto-fixes in ruff; D401/D417 require semantic understanding.

## Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `multi_linter.sh` | PostToolUse hook - lints edited files |
| `protect_linter_configs.sh` | PreToolUse hook - blocks config & hook edits |
| `stop_config_guardian.sh` | Stop hook - detects config changes |
| `approve_configs.sh` | Helper - creates guard file for stop hook |
| `test_hook.sh` | Debug utility with `--self-test` suite |
| `README.md` | This documentation |

## Debugging

### View registered hooks

```bash
# In Claude Code session
/hooks
```

### Debug mode

```bash
claude --debug "hooks" --verbose
```

### Test hook manually

```bash
# Test single file
.claude/hooks/test_hook.sh path/to/file.sh

# Run comprehensive self-test suite
.claude/hooks/test_hook.sh --self-test
```

### Self-Test Suite

The `--self-test` flag runs automated tests covering:

**Dockerfile patterns**:

- `*.dockerfile` extension (valid content, expect pass)
- `*.dockerfile` extension (missing labels, expect fail)

**Other file types**:

- Python, Shell, JSON (valid), JSON (invalid), YAML

**Styled output format tests**:

- JSON violations output (`JSON_SYNTAX` code present)
- Dockerfile violations captured (`DL[0-9]+` codes present)

**Model selection tests**:

- Simple violation (F841) -> haiku
- Complexity violation (C901) -> sonnet
- Many violations (>5) -> opus
- Docstring violation (D103) -> sonnet

**TypeScript tests** (gated on Biome availability):

- Clean TS file -> exit 0
- TS unused variable -> exit 2
- JS clean file -> exit 0
- JSX a11y violation -> exit 2
- TS disabled -> exit 0 (skip)
- CSS clean -> exit 0
- CSS violation -> exit 2
- TS violations output contains `biome`
- Protected biome.json -> block
- TS simple -> haiku model
- TS >5 violations -> opus model
- JSON via Biome (D6) -> exit 0
- Biome not installed -> exit 0 (fallback)

Tests use temp files for content creation and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` override
for TypeScript-enabled config isolation.

## Testing Hooks Manually

### Test PostToolUse hook (multi_linter.sh)

```bash
# Test Python handler (should exit 0 for clean file)
echo 'def foo(): pass' > /tmp/test.py
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": "/tmp/test.py"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/multi_linter.sh
echo "Exit: $?"

# Test with violations - use HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS for deterministic exit codes
# Without it, subprocess would attempt fixes and exit code depends on success
cat > /tmp/complex.py << 'EOF'
def f(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k):
    if a: return b
EOF
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": "/tmp/complex.py"}}' \
  | HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS=1 bash .claude/hooks/multi_linter.sh
echo "Exit: $?"  # Exit 2 (violations reported, subprocess skipped)
```

### Test PreToolUse hook (protect_linter_configs.sh)

```bash
# Protected linter config (should return decision: block)
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": ".yamllint"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/protect_linter_configs.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "block", "reason": "Protected linter config file..."}

# Protected hook script (should return decision: block)
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": ".claude/hooks/multi_linter.sh"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/protect_linter_configs.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "block", "reason": "Protected Claude Code config..."}

# Protected settings (should return decision: block)
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": ".claude/settings.json"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/protect_linter_configs.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "block", "reason": "Protected Claude Code config..."}

# Normal file (should return decision: approve)
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": "/tmp/normal.py"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/protect_linter_configs.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "approve"}
```

## Hook Schema Reference

| Hook Type | Schema | Exit Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PreToolUse | `{"decision": "approve/block"}` | 0 |
| PostToolUse | Exit codes only (no JSON) | 0 or 2 |
| Stop | `{"decision": "approve/block"}` | 0 |

**PostToolUse behavior**: Exit 0 = no issues, Exit 2 = stderr fed to Claude.

## Hook Invocation Behavior

The PreToolUse hook fires on **all** Edit/Write operations, not just protected
files. This is by design -- Claude Code matchers only support tool names, not file
paths.

**What you see:**

```text
Write(src/app/utils.py)
  PreToolUse:Write hook succeeded: Success
```

**What it means:**

- "Succeeded" = hook ran and returned a decision
- For non-protected files: hook approves immediately (fast path)
- For protected files: hook denies with reason

The hook uses internal filtering (path/basename matching) to determine
protection. This architecture is intentional and provides maximum flexibility
for file-level logic.

## Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `hooks.PreToolUse`: Command hook for file-level protection (blocks edits)
- `hooks.PostToolUse`: Command hook for linting (Edit/Write matcher)
- `hooks.Stop`: Command hook for config restoration (detects changes via git)

## Runtime Configuration (config.json)

The hooks read `.claude/hooks/config.json` at startup for runtime configuration.
If the file is missing, all features are enabled with sensible defaults.

### Configuration Options

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `languages.<type>` | bool | true | Per-language toggle |
| `languages.typescript` | object | — | TS/JS/CSS config |
| `…typescript.enabled` | bool | false | Enable TS/JS/CSS |
| `…typescript.js_runtime` | string | "auto" | auto/node/bun/pnpm |
| `…typescript.biome_nursery` | string | "warn" | off/warn/error |
| `…typescript.semgrep` | bool | true | Semgrep session scan |
| `protected_files` | str[] | 14 configs | Protected from edits |
| `exclusions` | str[] | tests/,… | Security lint exclusions |
| `phases.auto_format` | bool | true | Phase 1 auto-format |
| `phases.subprocess_delegation` | bool | true | Phase 3 subprocess |
| `subprocess.timeout` | number | 300 | Timeout (seconds) |
| `subprocess.model_selection.*` | varies | varies | Model routing patterns |
| `jscpd.*` | varies | varies | Duplicate detection |

### Example: Disable Markdown Linting

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "markdown": false
  }
}
```

Environment variables override config.json values:

- `HOOK_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT` overrides `subprocess.timeout`
- `HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS=1` disables subprocess regardless of config

## Defense in Depth: Prevention + Recovery

The hooks use a two-layer protection strategy:

| Layer | Hook | When | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | PreToolUse | Before edit | Block ALL edits to config files |
| 2 | Stop | Session end | Detect changes, offer restoration |

**Layer 1: PreToolUse** (`protect_linter_configs.sh`):

- Blocks modifications to entire files:
  - `.markdownlint.jsonc`
  - `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`
  - `.shellcheckrc`
  - `.yamllint`
  - `.hadolint.yaml`
  - `.jscpd.json`
  - `.flake8`
  - `taplo.toml`
  - `.ruff.toml`
  - `ty.toml`
  - `.claude/hooks/*` (entire hooks directory)
  - `.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code settings)
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` (local overrides)
- Returns `{"decision": "block"}` to prevent edit
- User can explicitly approve blocked edits (override)

**Layer 2: Stop** (`stop_config_guardian.sh`):

- Runs when session ends
- Uses `git diff` to detect modified config files (programmatic, no LLM)
- If changes detected:
  1. Checks hash-based guard file for prior approval
  2. If hashes match -> allows session to end (no re-prompt)
  3. If no guard or hash mismatch -> blocks and prompts user
  4. Claude uses AskUserQuestion to ask user
  5. User chooses: restore to last commit OR keep changes
  6. If keep: creates guard file with content hashes via `approve_configs.sh`
  7. If restore: runs `git checkout -- <file>` for each modified file
- Catches user-approved edits that bypassed PreToolUse

**Why both?** PreToolUse prevents tampering in real-time. Stop provides a
safety net for user-approved changes, allowing undo before session ends.

### Hash-Based Guard Mechanism

The stop hook uses content hashes to prevent re-prompting when the user has
already approved config modifications within the same session:

**Guard File**: `/tmp/stop_hook_approved_${PPID}.json`

```json
{
  "approved_at": "2026-01-04T19:48:11Z",
  "files": {
    ".yamllint": "sha256:ffb4f4f50a840ec57276cb67c848bd5239ad25af01411d65ee984ca177077c7c"
  }
}
```

**Behavior**:

| Scenario | Guard File | Hashes | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First session end | None | N/A | Block, prompt user |
| Same content, same session | Exists | Match | Approve (no re-prompt) |
| New content after approval | Exists | Mismatch | Block, re-prompt |
| Different session | None (PPID changed) | N/A | Block, prompt user |

**Helper Script**: `approve_configs.sh` creates the guard file when user
selects "Keep changes". Claude invokes it via:

```bash
.claude/hooks/approve_configs.sh ${PPID} .yamllint .flake8
```

This prevents the "flaky re-prompting" issue where the stop hook would ask
about the same unchanged files multiple times within a session.

## Stop Hook Schema

The Stop hook MUST return JSON matching this schema:

```json
{"decision": "approve"}
{"decision": "block", "reason": "...", "systemMessage": "..."}
```

- `decision`: "approve" (allow session to end) or "block" (prevent exit)
- `reason`: Directive that Claude reads to know how to proceed
- `systemMessage`: User-facing warning message (advisory)

### Field Semantics

**Important**: When forcing tool use (like AskUserQuestion), put the instruction
in `reason`, not `systemMessage`:

- **`reason`**: What Claude reads for its next action. Put tool invocation
  directives here (e.g., "Use AskUserQuestion tool NOW").
- **`systemMessage`**: Shown to the user as context. Keep brief and
  informational.

Claude may ignore instructions in `systemMessage` if it has prior context about
the changes. The `reason` field is authoritative for Claude's behavior.

**Note**: Stop hooks use the same `decision` field as PreToolUse, not `ok`.

**Loop Prevention**: Stop hooks receive a `stop_hook_active` boolean
in their input JSON. When `true`, Claude Code is continuing from a prior
stop hook block. Your hook MUST check this and return `{"decision": "approve"}`
to prevent infinite loops:

```bash
input=$(cat)
stop_hook_active=$(jaq -r '.stop_hook_active // false' <<<"${input}")
[[ "${stop_hook_active}" == "true" ]] && echo '{"decision": "approve"}' && exit 0
```

## Model Configuration

Prompt hooks support an optional `model` field:

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "prompt": "...",
  "timeout": 60
}
```

- Default: Haiku (fast, small model)
- Sonnet: Better reasoning for complex validation
- Opus: Maximum capability (if available)

## Dependencies

**Required:**

- `jaq` - JSON parsing (Rust jq alternative)
- `ruff` - Python formatting and linting
- `claude` - Claude Code CLI (for subprocess delegation)

**Optional (gracefully skipped if not installed):**

- `ty` - Python type checking (Astral's Rust-based type checker)
- `pydantic` - Pydantic model linting
- `vulture` - Dead code detection (uses `vulture_whitelist.py` for false positives)
- `bandit` - Security scanning (uses `pyproject.toml [tool.bandit]`)
- `shfmt` - Shell script formatting
- `shellcheck` - Shell script linting
- `yamllint` - YAML linting (baseline fully enforced)
- `hadolint` - Dockerfile linting (>= 2.12.0 recommended)
- `taplo` - TOML formatting and linting
- `markdownlint-cli2` - Markdown linting
- `jscpd` - Duplicate code detection (via npx, no install needed)
- `biome` - TypeScript/JS/CSS formatting and linting (via npm/npx)
- `semgrep` - Security scanning for TS/JS (session-scoped, advisory)

**Tool Invocation Pattern:** The hook uses `uv run` to invoke project
dependencies (ty, pydantic), leveraging the project's virtual
environment without hardcoded path discovery. This follows the thin
wrapper principle - configuration lives in config files, the hook
delegates execution to the project's toolchain.

**hadolint Version Check:** The hook verifies hadolint >= 2.12.0 at runtime.
Older versions will trigger a warning but still run (graceful degradation).
Version 2.12.0+ is required for `disable-ignore-pragma` support.

**claude Command Discovery:** The hook searches for claude in this order:

1. `claude` in PATH (standard install)
2. `~/.local/bin/claude` (user install)
3. `~/.npm-global/bin/claude` (npm global)
4. `/usr/local/bin/claude` (system install)

If not found, outputs `[hook:error] claude binary not found, cannot delegate`.

## Subprocess Hook Prevention

The subprocess spawned in Phase 3 uses `--settings ~/.claude/no-hooks-settings.json`
to disable hooks during subprocess execution. The subprocess uses `--settings`
flag to prevent recursive hook invocation.

**Why this is needed:**

- `claude -p` subprocesses inherit hooks from the parent session by default
- When the subprocess uses Edit to fix violations, the PostToolUse hook fires again
- Without prevention, this causes recursive subprocess spawning and added latency

**Why this is safe:**

- The parent hook's `rerun_phase2()` runs after subprocess exit
- This verification step catches any remaining violations
- Violations are not masked - they're reported by the parent

**Settings file** (`~/.claude/no-hooks-settings.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "disableAllHooks": true
}
```

## Subprocess Model Selection

The subprocess uses dynamic model selection based on violation complexity:

| Violation Type | Model | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple (F841, SC2034) | haiku | Fast, cheap |
| YAML (line-length, indentation) | haiku | Config formatting |
| JSON/TOML syntax errors | haiku | Syntax fixes |
| Dockerfile (DL3007, DL3008) | haiku | Pin/label additions |
| Complexity (C901, PLR*) | sonnet | Refactoring reasoning |
| Pydantic (PYD001-PYD006) | sonnet | Pydantic knowledge |
| FastAPI (FAST001-003) | sonnet | Framework-specific patterns |
| Type errors (unresolved-import) | sonnet | Import resolution |
| **Markdown (MD013, MD060)** | sonnet | Semantic shortening |
| **Docstrings (D001-D418)** | sonnet | Semantic rewriting |
| Complex type (unresolved-attribute) | opus | Architectural changes |
| >5 violations (any type) | opus | Volume analysis |

**Note on Markdown**: MD013 (line length) and MD060 (table style) require
semantic understanding to fix properly. The subprocess receives a specialized
prompt with fix strategies:

- MD013: Shorten content while preserving meaning (not wrap)
- MD060: Add spaces around ALL pipes in separator rows
- Tables: Edit entire rows to maintain column consistency

**Note on Docstrings**: D rules (pydocstyle) require semantic understanding.
The subprocess receives a specialized prompt with fix strategies:

- D401: Change imperative mood ("Returns" -> "Return")
- D417: Add Args section from function signature
- D205/D400/D415: Fix formatting and punctuation

### Model Selection Trade-offs

| Model | Speed | Cost | Capability | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Haiku | ~5s | Lowest | Basic | Simple (F841, SC2034) |
| Sonnet | ~15s | Medium | Good | Refactoring, Pydantic |
| Opus | ~25s | Highest | Best | Complex types, >5 issues |

### Selection Logic (lines 57-81 in `multi_linter.sh`)

```bash
model="haiku"  # default
if [[ has_sonnet_codes ]]; then model="sonnet"; fi
if [[ has_opus_codes ]] || [[ count > 5 ]]; then model="opus"; fi
```

### Model Selection Pattern Constants

The sonnet and opus code patterns are defined as readonly constants at the script
top to ensure consistency between the actual model selection (spawn_fix_subprocess)
and debug output (HOOK_DEBUG_MODEL=1):

```bash
# Single source of truth for model selection patterns
readonly SONNET_CODE_PATTERN='C901|PLR[0-9]+|PYD[0-9]+|FAST[0-9]+|ASYNC[0-9]+|unresolved-import|MD[0-9]+|D[0-9]+'
readonly OPUS_CODE_PATTERN='unresolved-attribute|type-assertion'
```

**Pattern Components**:

| Pattern | Codes Matched | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C901` | McCabe complexity | Refactoring required |
| `PLR[0-9]+` | Pylint refactoring | PLR0913, PLR0915, etc. |
| `PYD[0-9]+` | Pydantic model | PYD001-PYD006 |
| `FAST[0-9]+` | FastAPI patterns | FAST001-003 |
| `ASYNC[0-9]+` | Async patterns | ASYNC100+ |
| `unresolved-import` | Type checker | Import resolution |
| `MD[0-9]+` | Markdown | MD001-MD065 |
| `D[0-9]+` | Docstrings | D100-D420 |

**Why Constants**: When new linter categories are added (e.g., ASYNC patterns),
only the constant definition needs updating. See config.json for pattern
configuration. This prevents the debug regex from getting out of sync with
the actual model selection logic.

## Testing Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Used By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS` | Skip delegation, report directly | test_hook.sh |
| `HOOK_DEBUG_MODEL` | Output model selection | test_hook.sh |
| `HOOK_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for subprocess (300s) | multi_linter.sh |

Example usage:

```bash
# Test model selection without spawning subprocess
echo '{"tool_input": {"file_path": "/tmp/test.py"}}' \
  | HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS=1 HOOK_DEBUG_MODEL=1 .claude/hooks/multi_linter.sh
# Output: [hook:model] haiku
```

### Debug Output Locations

There are **TWO** debug output blocks for model selection:

1. **Inside spawn_fix_subprocess() (lines 85-87)** - Verbose format with counts:

   ```text
   [hook:model] haiku (count=3, opus_codes=false, sonnet_codes=false)
   ```

   Only reached during normal execution (when HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS is not set).

2. **Script-level (lines 560-584)** - Simple format:

   ```text
   [hook:model] haiku
   ```

   Runs before HOOK_SKIP_SUBPROCESS check, allowing tests to verify model
   selection without spawning subprocesses.

## Linter Configuration Files

Linter configurations use standalone config files in the project root. This
separation improves maintainability and aligns with each tool's canonical
location.

| Linter | Config File |
| --- | --- |
| Ruff | `.ruff.toml` |
| ty | `ty.toml` |
| pydantic | `.flake8` |
| vulture | `vulture_whitelist.py` (false positive suppression) |
| bandit | `pyproject.toml [tool.bandit]` |
| ShellCheck | `.shellcheckrc` (maximum enforcement) |
| yamllint | `.yamllint` (all 23 rules configured) |
| hadolint | `.hadolint.yaml` (maximum strictness) |
| taplo | `taplo.toml` |
| markdownlint | `.markdownlint.jsonc`, `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` |
| jscpd | `.jscpd.json` (5% threshold) |
| Biome | `biome.json` (TS/JS/CSS formatting + linting) |
| Semgrep | `.semgrep.yml` (security rules for TS/JS) |

**Note on Taplo:** Auto-formatting is now applied via `taplo fmt`. Only syntax
errors that cannot be auto-fixed are reported. See `taplo.toml` for config.

<!-- Note: Uses .flake8 config for per-file-ignores -->

**Note on Markdown (Two-Layer Enforcement):** Markdownlint uses a scoped
enforcement model to balance strict standards with practical constraints:

| Layer | Scope | Config | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hook (PostToolUse) | ALL `.md` files | `.markdownlint*.jsonc` | Boy Scout |
| CI (pre-commit) | Maintained only | `.markdownlintignore` | Zero violations |

**CI-Scoped Paths** (must have zero violations):

- `*.md` at repo root (README.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
- `.claude/**/*.md` (except `.tmp/`, `plans/`, `skills/*/reports/`)
- `docs/**/*.md` (curated documentation)

**Excluded from CI** (but still linted by hook when edited):

- `.claude/.tmp/`, `.claude/plans/`, `.claude/skills/*/reports/`
- `data/`, `tmp/`
- Build artifacts (`.venv/`, `node_modules/`)

This model achieves zero violations on maintained files without requiring fixes
to large numbers of violations in legacy/auto-generated docs. The hook ensures
gradual cleanup via Boy Scout Rule: edit a file, own all its violations.

## Python Formatter Decision

**Decision**: Use ruff format exclusively. Do not add Black.

### Comparison (January 2026)

| Criterion | Ruff | Black |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Performance | 0.10s (250k lines) | 3.20s (250k lines) |
| Speed ratio | 1x (baseline) | 32x slower |
| Compatibility | >99.9% Black-compatible | N/A |
| Language | Rust | Python |
| Config | .ruff.toml | pyproject.toml |

### Rationale

1. **Performance**: Ruff is 30x faster than Black, easily meeting the 500ms
   constraint
2. **Compatibility**: >99.9% Black-compatible output means no quality loss
3. **Simplicity**: Single tool for both formatting and linting reduces
   complexity
4. **Official guidance**: Astral (ruff maintainers) explicitly states "not
   intended to be used interchangeably with Black"

### Minor Differences from Black

Ruff differs from Black in edge cases (per Astral documentation):

- Expression collapsing (may fit more on one line)
- F-string formatting (normalizes quotes and spacing)
- Trailing commas in function definitions

These differences are intentional and considered improvements by the ruff team.

### Verification

Verify formatting performance by timing a format operation:

```bash
time ruff format --quiet src/app/utils.py
```

Expected: All files format in <100ms (well under 500ms constraint).

## Linter Output Processing

### Why Structured JSON Instead of Raw Output?

The hook (bash script) generates structured JSON for two reasons:

1. **Unified format** - Different linters have different output formats. JSON
   normalizes them.
2. **Easier for subprocess** - The subprocess can parse exact line/column to
   make targeted edits.

```

**Fragility examples:**

- **yamllint** (lines 428-435): Breaks if message contains `:` or `()`
  characters, or if level becomes uppercase `[ERROR]`
- **flake8** (lines 379-386): Breaks if file path contains `:` or code format
  changes (e.g., `PYD-002` instead of `PYD002`)
- **markdownlint** (lines 532-538): Breaks if output format or rule names change

### Mitigation Options Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep current sed parsing | Simple, works now | Fragile, version-dependent |
| Use `--format json` where available | Robust | Not all tools support it |
| Pass raw linter output to subprocess | Simpler hook | Subprocess must parse |
| Fail gracefully on parse errors | Safer | May miss violations |

**Decision**: Keep sed parsing for all three tools. The formats are stable and
the parsing is well-tested. Native JSON alternatives either don't exist
(yamllint, flake8) or require complex configuration (markdownlint-cli2
outputFormatters).

### markdownlint-cli2 JSON Output (Investigated, Not Implemented)

While markdownlint-cli2 supports JSON output via outputFormatters, it requires:

1. Installing `markdownlint-cli2-formatter-json` npm package
2. Configuring `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` with outputFormatters
3. Output goes to a file, not stdout

This overhead is not justified given:

- The current sed parsing works reliably
- The output format is stable
- The hook would need to manage temp files

### yamllint Conversion Example

```bash
# yamllint raw output: "file.yaml:5:3: [error] wrong indentation (indentation)"

yaml_json=$(echo "${yamllint_output}" | while IFS= read -r line; do
  line_num=$(echo "${line}" | sed -E 's/.*:([0-9]+):[0-9]+: .*/\1/')
  col_num=$(echo "${line}" | sed -E 's/.*:[0-9]+:([0-9]+): .*/\1/')
  msg=$(echo "${line}" | sed -E 's/.*\[[a-z]+\] ([^(]+).*/\1/')
  code=$(echo "${line}" | sed -E 's/.*\(([^)]+)\).*/\1/')
  jaq -n --arg l "${line_num}" --arg c "${col_num}" --arg cd "${code}" --arg m "${msg}" \
    '{line:($l|tonumber),column:($c|tonumber),code:$cd,message:$m,linter:"yamllint"}'
done | jaq -s '.')
```

### Why flake8 JSON Would Need a Plugin

Flake8 has no built-in JSON output format. To get JSON output, you must
write a custom formatter plugin:

```python
from flake8.formatting.base import BaseFormatter
import json

class JSONFormatter(BaseFormatter):
    def format(self, error):
        return json.dumps({
            'filename': error.filename,
            'line': error.line_number,
            'column': error.column_number,
            'code': error.code,
            'text': error.text
        })
```

Then register as an entry point and invoke with `flake8 --format=json`. This is
significant overhead for parsing 6 stable rule codes (PYD001-PYD006), so we keep
sed parsing.

**Note on hadolint:** The hook uses `--no-color` flag to strip ANSI escape
sequences from output. Configuration uses maximum strictness with:

- `failure-threshold: warning` (stricter than default `info`)
- `disable-ignore-pragma: true` (prevents inline `# hadolint ignore=xxx`
  bypasses)
- `label-schema` enforcement (requires `maintainer` and `version` labels)
- Documented ignores only for version pinning rules (DL3008/DL3013/DL3018)

**Note on JSON (\*):** The JSON handler uses `cmp -s` to compare formatted
output with the original file before replacing. This idempotency check prevents
unnecessary file timestamp updates when content is already properly formatted.

**Note on jscpd (Phase 2c):** Duplicate code detection runs in **advisory mode**
only for Python files. Key characteristics:

- **Session-scoped**: Only runs once per session after 3+ Python files modified
- **Advisory only**: Reports duplicates but does NOT block (no
  `has_issues=true`)
- **Caching**: Uses `/tmp/.jscpd_session_${PPID}` to track files and `.done`
  marker
- **Threshold**: 5% duplication allowed, 10 min lines, 50 min tokens
- **Coverage**: Scans directories configured in config.json and .jscpd.json
- **Excludes**: Tests, data, docs, .claude/.tmp (per .jscpd.json ignore list)

This provides awareness of code duplication without disrupting development flow.
Run `npx jscpd --config .jscpd.json` for current baseline.

## Testing Stop Hook

### Test manually (simulates session end)

```bash
# No modifications - should approve
echo '{"stop_hook_active": false}' | bash .claude/hooks/stop_config_guardian.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "approve"}

# With modifications (first invocation) - should block
echo "# test" >> .yamllint
echo '{"stop_hook_active": false}' | bash .claude/hooks/stop_config_guardian.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "block", "reason": "...", "systemMessage": "..."}

# Loop prevention (second invocation) - should approve
echo '{"stop_hook_active": true}' | bash .claude/hooks/stop_config_guardian.sh
# Expected: {"decision": "approve"}

# Restore after test
git checkout -- .yamllint
```

### Integration test (requires session restart)

1. Start new Claude Code session
2. Approve an edit to a protected config file
3. End session (Ctrl+C or /exit)
4. Stop hook should trigger, asking to restore
5. Choose "Yes, restore" or "No, keep"

## Implementation Details

This section documents internal behaviors of the hook implementation.

### Subprocess Exit Code Handling

The hook captures and logs subprocess exit codes instead of swallowing them
with `|| true`. This provides visibility into subprocess failures:

```text
[hook:warning] subprocess timed out (exit 124)
[hook:warning] subprocess failed (exit 3)
```

Exit code 124 specifically indicates timeout (from `timeout` command). Other
non-zero codes indicate subprocess errors. These warnings appear on stderr
but do not block the hook from continuing.

### Subprocess Timeout Configuration

The subprocess runs with a 5-minute (300 second) timeout by default. This
prevents runaway processes from blocking the hook indefinitely.

**Configuration**:

```bash
# Override default 300 second timeout
HOOK_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT=600 claude ...
```

The `timeout` command is used, which sends SIGTERM on expiration. Exit code
124 indicates the timeout was reached.

**macOS Dependency**: The `timeout` command requires GNU coreutils:

```bash
brew install coreutils
```

If `timeout` is not available, the subprocess runs without a timeout limit
(graceful fallback).

### Path Normalization for Security Linters

The `is_excluded_from_security_linters()` function normalizes absolute paths
to relative paths using `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (set automatically by Claude
Code for all hooks):

```bash
# Input: /home/user/project/tests/test_foo.py
# Normalized: tests/test_foo.py
# Result: Matches tests/* exclusion pattern
```

This ensures exclusion patterns like `tests/*` work correctly regardless of
whether the hook receives absolute or relative paths.

### Settings File Auto-Creation

The subprocess requires `~/.claude/no-hooks-settings.json` to prevent
recursive hook invocation. If this file is missing, the hook auto-creates it:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "disableAllHooks": true
}
```

A warning is logged when auto-creation occurs:

```text
[hook:warning] created missing ~/.claude/no-hooks-settings.json
```

The settings file creation uses an atomic `mktemp+mv` pattern to handle
concurrent hook invocations safely. If multiple hooks detect a missing file
simultaneously:

1. Each creates a unique temp file via `mktemp "${settings_file}.XXXXXX"`
2. Each attempts `mv` to the final location
3. First `mv` succeeds; others fail (file already exists)
4. Failed processes clean up their temp files silently

This follows ShellCheck SC2094 guidance: use `if mv ...; then success; else
cleanup; fi` pattern instead of `mv ... || rm` to ensure the warning message
only fires for the process that actually created the file.
