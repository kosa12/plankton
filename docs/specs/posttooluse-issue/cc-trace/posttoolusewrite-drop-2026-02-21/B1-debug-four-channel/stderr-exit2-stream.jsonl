According to the CLAUDE.md file, I need to fix these violations immediately when the PostToolUse hook reports them. The hook is blocking because there are linting violations.\n\nHowever, I don't have visibility into what those violations are from the hook message. The message just says \"3 violation(s) remain after delegation\" but doesn't show what they are.\n\nLooking at the error message, it's coming from a hook script at `/Users/alex/Documents/GitHub/plankton/.claude/tests/hooks/posttoolusewrite-drop-2026-02-21/B1-debug-four-channel/hook-stderr-exit2.sh`. This appears to be a test hook.\n\nThe issue is that I don't have information about what the violations are. I should try to understand what linting rules might be applied. But wait - I just wrote \"hello\" to the file. There shouldn't be any violations with that simple content.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The hook is saying violations remain after delegation. This could mean:\n1. The linter found issues\n2. The automated fixes didn't resolve all of them\n3. I need to manually fix what remains\n\nBut I don't have visibility into what the specific violations are. The hook message doesn't tell me what the violations are. I should ask the user or try to look at the file to see if there's something I'm missing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the path - this is in `.claude/tests/hooks/posttoolusewrite-drop-2026-02-21/B1-debug-four-channel/` - this is a test directory. This seems to be a test of the hook behavior.\n\nThe issue is that I can't see what the violations are from the error message alone. I need more information about what linting rules are being applied or what the actual violations are. Let me check if I can read the file to see its contents, or if there's a way to understand what the violations might be.\n\n\nSince the hook message doesn't specify what the violations are, I should ask what remains to be fixed rather than guessing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":336,"cache_read_input_tokens":31842,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":336},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f1f550eb-ba15-4167-bdd6-def4661751a7","uuid":"3d31849d-b0a4-4372-8c0e-4bf83e3e3016"}
