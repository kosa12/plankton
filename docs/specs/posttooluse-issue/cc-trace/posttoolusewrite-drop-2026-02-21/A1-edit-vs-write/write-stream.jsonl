It says violations \"remain after delegation\" - this suggests the hook tried to auto-fix but some violations persisted. I should read the file to see what's actually there, or check if there are any linting errors reported.\n\nActually, looking at the CLAUDE.md again, it says:\n\"Fix violations immediately when the PostToolUse hook reports them\"\n\nBut the hook error doesn't tell me what the violations are.
