## Recommendations

### sed parsing fragility (YAML/flake8)

The yamllint and flake8 parsable output is converted to JSON via
`sed` + `jaq` pipelines. Lines containing colons, parentheses, or
brackets in messages can confuse the regex. Consider switching to
native JSON output where available (yamllint does not support it;
flake8 supports `--format=json` in newer versions).

### Biome JSON reporter stability

Biome's `--reporter=json` output structure can change between
versions. The span-to-line conversion uses `split("\n")` on
sourceCode which may break if sourceCode is absent. Pin biome
version or add defensive nil checks in the jaq pipeline.

### Path handling edge cases

Files outside `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` lose relative path conversion
for biome. The `_biome_relpath()` function falls back to absolute
paths, which biome may reject for project-scoped rules. Consider
warning when file is outside project root.

### Config toggle interaction bugs

When `auto_format=false` and `subprocess_delegation=false`, the
hook still runs Phase 2 and exits 2 on violations. This is correct
behavior but may surprise users who expect the hook to be fully
disabled. Consider a `hook_enabled=false` master toggle.

### Model selection boundary correctness

The volume threshold uses `>` (strictly greater than), so exactly
5 violations selects haiku/sonnet, not opus. This is intentional
but should be documented clearly. The boundary is at 6+ violations.

### Missing tool graceful degradation

All tool checks use `command -v` and skip gracefully. The only
hard dependency is `jaq` for JSON parsing. If jaq is missing, the
hook cannot function. Consider a startup check that warns if jaq
is not available.
